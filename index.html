      <p>Today is your day, and even if I’m not with you physically, I’m with you in every other way.</p>
      <p>You’re one of the kindest, deepest, and most genuine people I’ve ever known.</p>
      <p>You know how to listen. You feel things deeply. You love with presence. And you know how to be there for people like no one else.</p>
      <p>I want you to know how proud I am of you. Proud of the person you are.</p>
      <p>You’re not just smart and beautiful — you’re strong and real.</p>
      <p>You manage to be a daughter, a friend, a girlfriend, a student — and still stay true to yourself.</p>
      <p>You hold so much warmth in you, and you never force it.</p>
      <p>You don’t just live — you bring meaning. That’s your power.</p>
      <p>You made my day special just by inviting me to that concert and spending the evening with me. And thank you for your letter. It was real. Just like you.</p>
      <p>On your birthday, I want to wish you one thing: to be truly happy. Not the loud kind of happy. The quiet, peaceful, real kind.</p>
      <p>I hope you’re always surrounded by people who see in you what I see — people who love you not for what you do, but for who you are.</p>
      <p>You mean so much to me. And I’m grateful for everything we’ve shared — and everything still ahead.</p>
